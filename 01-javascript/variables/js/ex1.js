The Fortune Teller

Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numChildren = 4;
var partner = 'Gary';
var geoLocation = 'Hawaii';
var jobTitle = 'Window cleaner';

var fortune = 'You will be a ' + jobTitle + ' in ' + geoLocation + ', and married to ' + partner + ' with ' + numChildren + ' kids.';

console.log(fortune);
